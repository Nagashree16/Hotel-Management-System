# Hotel-Management-System
The Hotel Management System uses Python's Tkinter library to create a user-friendly interface. Customers can browse rooms, check availability, and book their stay. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MySQL database to manage bookings, room availability, and customer details including food preferences.
